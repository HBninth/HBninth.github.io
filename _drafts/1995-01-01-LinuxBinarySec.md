# Linux Security - All in One

## 0 Preface

I got the idea *All in One* when I first knew there is a book named *CISSP All in One*. I really want to write a book gathering most of knowledge and techniques I learnt from books, documents, videos and other people. I am going to have a try to summary what I learnt and what I hacked.

Also, I want to share with other hackers. You know, to be a really hacker, or something like a information security engineer, you must keey to learn and practice like a sponge. You must try and try and try; you must be proactive. Well, this process is exciting and amazing if you really love this field. however, you have to look for resources from the whole Internet. That is why I want to write such a book. I want to provide a resource of high quality for the newbies towards the cyber security field.

I must say sorry that this book lays less stress on *Web Security* because I have little experience in this field (Maybe I will learn about it in the future, or not. Who knows).

Life is colorful, so it is the same with hacking.

This book is dedicated to the girl, and my parents.
