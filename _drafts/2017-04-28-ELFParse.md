## ELF Parser

### Preface

- To learn more about **ELF format**,you can read my translation of **TIS 1.1** [here](https://brant-ruan.github.io/linux/2016/08/25/ELF-%E6%A0%87%E5%87%86.html).
- To explore ELF on Linux, `/usr/include/elf.h` is valuable.
- Some tools are useful:
	- readelf
	- objdump
	- xxd

My goal is to program something like `readelf`, in order to learn ELF format in practice.  
Another paper of mine discuss ELF code injection, you can see [here](https://brant-ruan.github.io/linux/2017/04/28/ELFInjection.html).

Let's go :)
